# Panda-Picks AI/ML Integration Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines our strategic plan to enhance the Panda-Picks NFL prediction system with advanced AI/ML capabilities. The goal is to improve prediction accuracy, enhance user experience, and create competitive advantages through intelligent automation and data analysis.

## Current System Assessment
Panda-Picks currently uses a rules-based approach for NFL game predictions, relying on:
- Team grades and historical performance data
