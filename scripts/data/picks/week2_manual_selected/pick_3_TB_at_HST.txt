- Baseline Model Edge: Overall edge -3.53 vs 2.0 → away (TB) qualifies but narrower margin demands sizing discipline.
- Unit-Level Differential (pick-adjusted): Off +5.30 / Def +5.53 (inverted from negatives) – Balanced moderate edges; no single overwhelming lever.
- Aspect Matchup Highlights: +16.02 Pressure Mismatch (pass pro resilience), -15.07 Explosive Pass headwind (must manufacture explosives), +1.31 Script Control near neutral.
- Aspect Liabilities: Explosive pass deficit increases dependence on sustained drives / red-zone conversion.
- Game Script Expectation: TB pursues controlled intermediate game early to keep negative explosive differential from mattering; clock / chain control shifts pressure onto HST efficiency.
- Line Evaluation: Market HST -2.5 → picking dog with internal fair closer to PK / TB small favorite; value via polarity flip.
- Teaser Consideration: +2.5 → +8.5 strong (captures 3/6/7) enhancing edge resilience.
- Risk / Failure Modes: (1) Failure to hit even one explosive tilts leverage to host. (2) Negative early drive script forces lower-probability vertical shots. (3) Red-zone stall cluster caps upside.
- Why This Still Rates as a Play: Protection buffer grants runway for incremental EPA accumulation despite explosive gap.
- Confidence Indicator: 69.3%
