- Baseline Model Edge: Overall edge -20.57 (away dominance) >> threshold → away (LA) flag with elite multi-channel margin potential.
- Unit-Level Differential (pick-adjusted): Off +17.08 / Def +10.77 – Massive offensive leverage plus sturdy defensive cushion; redundancy.
- Aspect Matchup Highlights: +45.35 Pressure Mismatch (pass pro vs opposing rush blowout), +1.69 Explosive Pass still positive, +20.04 Script Control – combined suggests sustained vertical + on-schedule threats.
- Aspect Liabilities: Minimal – moderate risk of situational run defense soft spots if game shortens possessions early.
- Game Script Expectation: LA accelerates tempo early leveraging protection gulf; once two scores up, balanced call sheet milks clock while pressure mismatch maintains clean pockets.
- Line Evaluation: Market TEN +5.5 vs fair near double digits; spread mispricing leaves secondary value beyond ML.
- Teaser Consideration: -5.5 → +0.5 mediocre (doesn’t cross +3). Straight spread preferable / alt lines viable.
- Risk / Failure Modes: (1) Early negative turnover swing compresses script. (2) Red-zone inefficiency transforms yardage edge into narrower lead. (3) Weather / field variance dampens protection advantage.
- Why This Still Rates as a Play: Protection + script control dual spikes drastically lower volatility of offensive floor, enabling compounding drives.
- Confidence Indicator: 99.3%
