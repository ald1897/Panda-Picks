- Baseline Model Edge: Overall edge -7.10 vs 2.0 → away (SF) valid with defense-forward posture.
- Unit-Level Differential (pick-adjusted): Off +0.82 / Def +11.82 – Defense carries thesis; offense neutral-plus.
- Aspect Matchup Highlights: -2.08 Pressure Mismatch (slight protection concern), -0.67 Explosive Pass near flat, -2.10 Script Control modest drag → reliance on defensive disruption & situational execution.
- Aspect Liabilities: Triple minor negatives raise sensitivity to turnover or field position variance.
- Game Script Expectation: SF leans defense to generate short fields; offensive approach emphasizes mistake avoidance until leverage established.
- Line Evaluation: Market NO +3.0 (SF -3) vs internal stronger lean; still playable with expectation of defensive drive compression.
- Teaser Consideration: -3.0 → +3.0 attractive corridor enhancer if paired; straight spread ok.
- Risk / Failure Modes: (1) Protection struggles amplify low explosive lean. (2) Special teams hidden yardage extends NO drives. (3) Early deficit stresses mediocre script control.
- Why This Still Rates as a Play: High defensive delta overcomes modest offensive stagnation risk; low fragility to single failure mode.
- Confidence Indicator: 82.9%
