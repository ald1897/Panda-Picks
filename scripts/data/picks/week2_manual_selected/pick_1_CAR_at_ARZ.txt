- Baseline Model Edge: Overall edge +4.8 (multi-factor threshold clearance)
- Unit-Level Differential: Off +3.1 / Def +2.9 (balanced profile)
- Game Script Expectation: Edge facilitates early leverage + mid-game pace control
- Line Evaluation: Posted -6.5 retains value vs internal fair (qualitative)
- Teaser Consideration: -6.5 -> -0.5 (+6.0 pts) crosses -6, -4, -3
- Risk / Failure Modes: Turnover clustering, explosive play variance, red-zone stalls
- Why This Still Rates as a Play: Redundant edges reduce reliance on a single outlier outcome
- Confidence Indicator: 24%
